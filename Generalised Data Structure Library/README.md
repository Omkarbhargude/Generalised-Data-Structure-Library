# Generalised Data Structure Library

## Technology

* **Language:** C++
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Style:** Template-based, generic, reusable

---

## Project Overview

The **Generalised Data Structure Library** is a reusable C++ library that provides object-oriented implementations of both **linear** and **non-linear** data structures.
It offers ready-to-use functionalities for fundamental as well as advanced operations, designed in a **generic way** using C++ templates so they can be reused with any data type.

The library follows clean OOP principles, emphasizing **modularity**, **extensibility**, and **reusability**, making it ideal for both academic learning and real-world application development.

## Key Features

### 1️⃣ Linear Data Structures

* Singly Linear Linked List
* Singly Circular Linked List
* Doubly Linear Linked List
* Doubly Circular Linked List
* Stack (LIFO)
* Queue (FIFO)

### 2️⃣ Non-Linear Data Structures

* Binary Search Tree (BST)

  * Supports insertion, deletion, and traversal operations

### 3️⃣ Algorithms

* **Searching:** Linear Search, Binary Search
* **Sorting:** Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.

---

## Generic Implementation

* Uses **C++ templates** for data type independence
* Works seamlessly with integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and custom objects

---

## Library Format

* Packaged as a **reusable C++ library**
* Can be linked with client applications for integration into larger projects

---

## Learning Outcomes

By using or studying this library, you will:

* Gain mastery over **C++ Object-Oriented Programming** concepts
* Build a strong foundation in **linear** and **non-linear** data structures
* Learn to implement **generic programming** with templates
* Understand and apply **searching and sorting algorithms**
* Acquire experience in designing **reusable software libraries**

---

## About `main.cpp`

* `examples/main.cpp` is a **demonstration program** that shows how to use the library’s data structures and algorithms.
* It serves as a guide for API usage, not as a test suite.

---

## Requirements

* A modern C++ compiler (e.g., **g++ 9** or later)
* Supported platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows (MinGW)

---

## Compilation & Execution

### Linux / macOS

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o myexe
./myexe
```

### Windows (MinGW)

```cmd
g++ main.cpp -o myexe
myexe.exe
```
