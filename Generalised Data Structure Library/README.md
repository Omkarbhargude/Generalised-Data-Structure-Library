-> Project Name :-  Generalised Data Structure Library

-> Teachnology  :-  C++ Programming

-> Project Overview :-
-  This project is C++ library of generic data structure that provides object-oriented implementation of both linear and non  
   linear data structure.
-  It offers ready-to-use functionalities for fundamental as well as advanced operations designed in a generic way using
   template so that they can be reused with any data type
-  The library is designed to support clean OOP principles, modularity, and extensibility making it suitable for both academic
   learning and real-world application development

-> Key Features :-

  1. Linear Data Structure :
     - Singly Linear Linked List
     - Singly Circular Linked List
     - Doubly Linear Linked List
     - Doubly Circular Linked List
     - Stack (LIFO)
     - Queue (FIFO)

  2. Non-Linear Data Structure :
     - Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert,delete,treversal operations.
    
  3. Algorithms :-
     - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search etc)
     - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort etc)

-> Generic Implemention :
  Uses C++ template for data type independence.
  Same information work for Integers, floats, string, etc.

-> Library Format :-
  Designed as a reusable C++ library that can ne linked with client application

-> Learning Outcomes :-
  - Mastery of C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
  - Strong foundation in linear and non-linear data structuer.
  - Implementation of generic programming with templates
  - Practical knowledge of searching and sorting algorithm
  - Expirenced in designing resuable libraries for software development.

   
## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` version 9 or later)  
- Linux, macOS, or Windows with MinGW

## Compilation and Execution

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Compile the program:
Linux -> g++ main.cpp -o myexe
./myexe
Windows -> g++ main.cpp -o myexe
myexe.exe
